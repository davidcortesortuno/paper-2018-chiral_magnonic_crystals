# Chiral Magnonics: Micromagnetic Simulations

This repository has all the necessary tools to reproduce the micromagnetic
simulations from the publication: **Chiral Magnonic Crystals: Breaking the Spin
Wave Symmetry with a Periodic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction**

## System

The system under study is a 3000 nm long and 200 nm wide Permalloy stripe with
a periodic DMI, which can be obtained by patterning periodic arrays of heavy
metal wires on top of the sample.

The periodicity in the sample depends on three factors: the periodicity
parameter `a`, the width of the ferromagnetic material `w` and the width of the
heavy metal wires `w_D`.

The simulations are specified for the limiting case `a=w` which is a
ferromagnet with periodic heavy metal wires on top, which induce a periodic
interfacial DMI. Accordingly, the system is solely determined by `a` and the
heavy metal widths `w_D`.

For example, for a system with `a=100 nm`, if we specify the heavy metal widths
as `w_D=a/2`, we obtain the pattern:

## Simulations

In our study, we fix the periodicity to a value of `a=100 nm` and we set
different heavy metal widths `w_D` of `a`, `a/2`, `a/4` and 0.

The first step in the simulations is to relax the sample with a strong magnetic
field of `B=0.25 T` to saturate the magnetisation along the `y` direction,
which is along the sample width.

After relaxation, we excite the system using a `sinc` pulse of `0.025 T` of
magnitude with a cutoff frequency of `60 GHz` and centered at `50 ps`. We apply
this excitation in a `4 nm` wide region at the middle of the stripe, as shown
in the first figure. The system dynamics during the excitation process
is saved every `0.5 ps` during `8000` steps, i.e. for `4 ns`.


## Damping

The theory is based on infinitely long and wide stripes. In the simulation we
use a finite width of 200 nm. We set a damping of `0.01` magnitude that
exponentially grows damping towards the width edges as shown in:

By setting the damping in this way, we can obtain clearer images of the
spin wave spectrum of the system.

## Spectrum

Using the scripts in the `data_plot` folder we extract the spin components
along the sample length at the middle of the stripe for every time step.
Consequently, we apply a 2D Fourier transform with a `hanning` window function.
To plot the spectrum we use either a `squared` or `log` scale for the power
intensity.

# Docker

If Docker is installed in your system, all the simulations and data processing 
scripts can be run automatically run using

```
    make run_all
```

This command builds a Docker container using the `joommf/oommf` image,
runs the simulations in the `sim` folder and generates the data using
the scripts in the `data_plot` folder.
